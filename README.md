# Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

 _Duration: Weekend Sprint_

Employee wage data was previously recorded and calculated by hand, leading to both human error and the danger of losing records. The company wanted a better way of storing data, and untuitive way of understanding afforability of their employees.

This employee wage calculator allows the user to add new employees to the table with name, ID, annual earnings, and job title input fields. This data is then added to the complete table of employees.

Once added, the employees data will update the monthly salary data of the company's employees, and will cause it to go in the red if it is above the allowed threshold of $20,000. 

Pressing the delete button on an employee's line will remove that employee from the table, and recalculate the total monthly earnings with the updated employee database.

## Usage

1. Update employee database by adding all missing employees using input fields.
2. Delete all employees no longer present in company by pressing delete button of their row.
3. Total Monthly Salary in the red will indicate more cuts need to be made to make payroll.
4. Up-to-date list of employees with a Total Monthy Salary not in the red indicates successfully making payroll.
